			<p class="dark"><strong>Step 1:
Directions:</strong> When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his name. He’s surrounded by strangers--boys whose memories are also gone. First, using your own words, define memory, identity, and sacrifice.  Next, briefly describe how these ideas relate back to The Maze Runner.
</p>
				<p class="dark">
<strong>Step 2:
Directions:</strong> Using your copy of The Maze Runner, complete this document in its entirety by the first school day of the 2019-2020 school year. As you read the text:
Track the universal ideas of memory, identity, and sacrifice (both the positive and negative effects).
Reflect on how these ideas had both personal ramifications (consequences) for Thomas, but also the other characters. 
Do a total of 5 entries in the chart below; we will do one before the school year ends together
</p>
				<p class="dark"><strong>Writing Prompt: What is the connection between the three ideas we’ve been exploring (memory, identity, sacrifice)? Using a specific moment from the text, consider the following questions to answer the prompt: Explain in a well-written paragraph:</strong>
What do you see as the connection between memory, identify, and sacrifice?
What specific moment/scene from the text illustrates this connection? How?
How is the relationship between these ideas complex? Can there be a negative side to each?
What in your personal experience helps you relate to an experience from the text?
This paragraph should contain at least 8 sentences

				<p>  When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his name. He’s surrounded by strangers—boys whose memories are also gone.
   Outside the towering stone walls that surround them is a limitless, ever-changing maze. It’s the only way out—and no one’s ever made it through alive.
   Then a girl arrives. The first girl ever. And the message she delivers is terrifying: Remember. Survive. Run.</p>
