			<p class="dark"><strong>Step 1: 
Directions:</strong> Write a description of what each word means to you:
				<br>Genre
				<br>Approach
				<br>Similarity
				<br>Limitation
				<br>Opportunity
</p>
			<p class="dark"><strong>Step 2:
				Directions:</strong> Using your copy of <u>Mary Poppins</u>, complete the document linked above in its entirety by the first school day of the 2019-2020 school year. As you read the text, think about:
				<br>How do different art forms approach the same story (book, feature film, stage musical)?
				<br>How are the art forms of book, film and stage production similar?
<br>What are the opportunities and limitations of the book?
				<br>What are the opportunities and limitations of the stage production?
				<br>What are the opportunities and limitations of the movie?
</p>
			<p class="dark"><strong>Writing Prompt: How do different art forms approach the same story?</strong>  <u>Mary Poppins</u> is that rare tale that has appeared in a variety of art forms:  books, a live feature film, and a Broadway stage musical. How are these art forms different?  How are they similar?  How do their opportunities and their limitations dictate how the story can be told?  What does each medium provide that the others do not?  Write a summarization describing the differences and similarities between these three art forms using supporting details from Mary Poppins.  Include a diagram, graphic organizer, or infographic to chart your information.  

<br><br>This paragraph should end up being at least 8 sentences in length, maybe more.

				<p>From the moment Mary Poppins arrives at Number Seventeen Cherry-Tree Lane, everyday life at the Banks house is forever changed. It all starts when Mary Poppins is blown by the east wind onto the doorstep of the Banks house. She becomes a most unusual nanny to Jane, Michael, and the twins. Who else but Mary Poppins can slide up banisters, pull an entire armchair out of an empty carpetbag, and make a dose of medicine taste like delicious lime-juice cordial? A day with Mary Poppins is a day of magic and make-believe come to life!</p>
