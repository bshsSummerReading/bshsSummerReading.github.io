			<p class="dark"><strong>Step 1:</strong> 
<strong>Directions:</strong> write a description of a holistic approach to effective bedside manner. Then briefly describe how bedside manner is important in the text, Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness.

</p> <p class="dark">
<strong>Step 2:</strong>
<strong>Directions:</strong> Using your copy of Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness, complete this document in its entirety by the first school day of the 2019-2020 school year. As you read the text:
Track ineffective bedside manner modeled by a medical professional
Reflect on how the medical professional should have interacted with the patient to be more effective in his or her bedside manner.
Do a total of 5 entries answering the three above bullet points using the chart below; we will do one before the school year ends together
</p>
				<p></p><p class="dark"><strong>Writing Prompt:</strong> choose one specific scene where a medical professional demonstrates ineffective bedside manner. Explain in a well-written paragraph:
The situation at hand; what was happening in the text at this time?
Why is this an example of ineffective bedside manner?
How do you think the patient felt during the interaction?  
What should the medical professional have done differently to demonstrate effective bedside manner?  
How would you feel if this happened to you or your family?
This paragraph should end up being at least 8 sentences in length, maybe more.
