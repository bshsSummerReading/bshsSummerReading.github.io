			<p class="dark"><strong>Step 1: 
Directions:</strong> Elon Musk’s career began with a foundation of passion, innovation, and creation. First, using your own words, define passion, innovation, and creation. Next, briefly describe how these three ideas relate back to Elon Musk’s story in Elon Musk and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.</p>
		<p class="dark"><strong>Step 2:
Directions:</strong> Using your copy of Elon Musk and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, complete this document in its entirety by the first school day of the 2019-2020 school year. As you read the text:
Track the universal ideas of passion, innovation, and creation (both the positive and negative effects).
Reflect on how these ideas had both personal ramifications (consequences) for Elon Musk, but also how these innovations affected society as a whole. 
Do a total of 5 entries in the chart below; we will do one before the school year ends together.

			<p class="dark"><strong>Writing Prompt: What is the connection between the three ideas we’ve been exploring (passion, creation, innovation)? Using a specific moment from the text, consider the following questions to answer the prompt:</strong>
What do you see as the connection between passion, creation, and innovation? 
What specific moment/scene from the text illustrates this connection? How?  
How is the relationship between these ideas complex? Can there be a negative side to each? 
What in your personal experience helps you relate to an experience from the text? 
This paragraph should contain at least 8 sentences
